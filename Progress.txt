music is done, but you can still hear the other person, when you have paused him, easy workarounds, have a mute functionality

function muteRemoteAudio(mute) {
    // Assuming `peerConnection` is your RTCPeerConnection instance
    peerConnection.getReceivers().forEach(receiver => {
        if (receiver.track && receiver.track.kind === "audio") {
            receiver.track.enabled = !mute;
        }
    });
}
